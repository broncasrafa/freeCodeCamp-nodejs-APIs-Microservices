## Managing Packages with NPM

npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js. 
There are many open source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't 
end up recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.

In this course, I learned the basics of using npm, including how to work with the package.json and how to manage your installed dependencies.

- How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package
- Add a Description to Your package.json
- Add Keywords to Your package.json
- Add a License to Your package.json
- Add a Version to Your package.json
- Expand Your Project with External Packages from npm
- Manage npm Dependencies By Understanding Semantic Versioning
- Use the Tilde-Character to Always Use the Latest Patch Version of a Dependency
- Use the Caret-Character to Use the Latest Minor Version of a Dependency
- Remove a Package from Your Dependencies
