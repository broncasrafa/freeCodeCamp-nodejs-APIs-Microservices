# Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges

## Basic Node and Express

**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules — small, independent programs — that help with this. Some of the core modules include HTTP, which acts like a server, and File System, a module to read and modify files.
In the last set of courses I learned to install and manage packages from npm, which are collections of smaller modules. These packages can help you build larger, more complex applications.

**Express** is a lightweight web application framework, and is one of the most popular packages on npm. Express makes it much easier to create a server and handle routing the routing for your application, which handles things like direct people to the correct page when they visit a certain endpoint like.

In this course, I learned the basics of Node and Express including how to create a server, serve different files, and handle different requests from the browser.

- Meet the Node console
- Start a Working Express Server
- Serve an HTML File
- Serve Static Assets
- Serve JSON on a Specific Route
- Use the .env File
- Implement a Root-Level Request Logger Middleware
- Chain Middleware to Create a Time Server
- Get Route Parameter Input from the Client
- Get Query Parameter Input from the Client
- Use body-parser to Parse POST Requests
- Get Data from POST Requests
